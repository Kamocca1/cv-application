# CV Export Functionality - Complete Implementation âœ…

## What Happens When You Click Export Buttons

### ðŸ“„ Export PDF Button

1. **Validation**: Checks if CV preview content exists
2. **Canvas Generation**: Captures the CV preview as a high-resolution image
3. **PDF Creation**: Embeds the image in a properly formatted A4 PDF
4. **Download**: Automatically downloads file as `YourName_CV_2025-08-27.pdf`
5. **User Feedback**: Shows success alert with filename

### ðŸ“„ Export Word Button

2. **HTML Generation**: Creates Word-compatible HTML with professional styling

4. **Download**: Automatically downloads file as `YourName_CV_2025-08-27.doc`

## File Download Behavior

**Automatic Download**: Both exports automatically save files to your browser's default Downloads folder (usually `~/Downloads` or `C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads`)

**No File Picker**: Files download immediately without showing a "Save As" dialog - this is the standard web browser behavior for programmatic downloads

**Filename Format**: `[YourName]_CV_[Date].[extension]`

-   Example: `John_Doe_CV_2025-08-27.pdf`
-   Example: `Jane_Smith_CV_2025-08-27.doc`

2. **Verify CV Data**: Make sure you've filled out some information
3. **Check Downloads Folder**: Files might be there even without notification
4. **Try Different Browser**: Test in Chrome if using another browser
