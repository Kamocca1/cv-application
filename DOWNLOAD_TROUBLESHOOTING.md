-   Check edge://settings/downloads

## Console Debugging

Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for these messages:

**PDF Export Success:**

```
PDF export button clicked
CV document element found: true
Starting PDF export...
Generating canvas...
Creating PDF...
Saving PDF: YourName_CV_2025-08-27.pdf
PDF export completed successfully
```

**Word Export Success:**

```
Word export button clicked
Starting Word export...
Creating Word document...
Downloading Word document: YourName_CV_2025-08-27.doc
Word export completed successfully
```

## Manual Testing Commands

You can test downloads directly in the browser console:

```javascript
// Test basic download functionality
const testBlob = new Blob(["test content"], { type: "text/plain" });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(testBlob);
const link = document.createElement("a");
link.href = url;
link.download = "test.txt";
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();
document.body.removeChild(link);
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
```

If this works, the export functions should work too.
