# CV Export Functionality - Fixed! âœ…

## Issues Resolved

### 1. PDF Export Issue

**Problem**: PDF export was working but files weren't downloading properly
**Solution**:

-   Fixed the DOM element selector to properly find the CV content
-   Improved error handling and user feedback
-   PDF now downloads automatically to your default downloads folder

### 2. Word Export Issue

**Problem**: "nodebuffer is not supported by this platform" error
**Solution**:

-   Replaced the `docx` library (which requires Node.js Buffer) with a browser-compatible HTML-based approach
-   Word documents are now generated as HTML files with `.doc` extension that Microsoft Word can open
-   Removed dependencies that don't work in browsers (`docx`, `file-saver`)

## How It Works Now

### PDF Export ðŸ“„

1. Click "ðŸ“„ Export PDF" button
2. The system captures the CV preview as a high-resolution image
3. Embeds it in a properly formatted A4 PDF
4. File downloads automatically as `YourName_CV_2025-08-27.pdf`

### Word Export ðŸ“„

1. Click "ðŸ“„ Export Word" button
2. The system generates HTML content with Word-compatible styling
3. Creates a `.doc` file that opens in Microsoft Word
4. File downloads automatically as `YourName_CV_2025-08-27.doc`

## File Download Behavior

-   Both exports now automatically download to your browser's default download folder
-   No file picker dialog - files save immediately
-   Filenames include your name and current date for easy organization

## Testing

1. Fill out some CV information (name, email, etc.)
2. Click either export button
3. Check your Downloads folder for the generated files
4. Open the files to verify they look correct
