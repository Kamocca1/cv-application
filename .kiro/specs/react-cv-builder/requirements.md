# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a React-based CV/Resume builder application using Vite and npm. The application will allow users to input, edit, and display their personal information, educational background, and work experience in a structured format. The application should follow SOLID design principles, use composition over inheritance, and provide a responsive design that works across different screen sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to input my general information (name, email, phone number), so that I can create a professional CV with my contact details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a form section for general information
2. WHEN I enter my name, email, and phone number THEN the system SHALL validate the input formats
3. WHEN I click submit THEN the system SHALL display my information in a formatted view
4. WHEN I click edit THEN the system SHALL show the input fields again with my previously entered data
5. IF the email format is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to add my educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study), so that I can showcase my academic background on my CV.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the education section THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for school name, title of study, and date of study
2. WHEN I submit my educational information THEN the system SHALL display it in a formatted education section
3. WHEN I click edit on the education section THEN the system SHALL restore the input fields with my previous data
4. WHEN I have multiple educational entries THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order
5. IF I leave required fields empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and show validation messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to add my practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities, employment dates), so that I can highlight my work history and achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the work experience section THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for company name, position title, main responsibilities, and employment dates (from and to)
2. WHEN I submit work experience information THEN the system SHALL display it in a formatted work experience section
3. WHEN I click edit on work experience THEN the system SHALL show input fields populated with existing data
4. WHEN I have multiple work experiences THEN the system SHALL display them in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
5. WHEN I enter responsibilities THEN the system SHALL support multi-line text input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want edit and submit buttons for each section, so that I can modify and save my information independently for different parts of my CV.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any completed section THEN the system SHALL display both edit and submit buttons
2. WHEN I click edit THEN the system SHALL switch that section to edit mode while keeping other sections in display mode
3. WHEN I click submit THEN the system SHALL validate the input and switch to display mode if valid
4. WHEN in edit mode THEN the system SHALL show a cancel option to revert changes
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL remain in edit mode and show error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use proper React component structure with a components directory, so that the code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL have a 'components' directory under 'src'
2. WHEN components are created THEN each component SHALL be in its own file within the components directory
3. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL follow SOLID design principles
4. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL favor composition over inheritance
5. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL properly use React props and state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS files organized in a styles directory, so that styling is properly separated and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL include a 'styles' directory under 'src'
2. WHEN components need styling THEN their CSS files SHALL be placed in the styles directory
3. WHEN CSS is used THEN it SHALL be properly imported into the respective component files
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN the design SHALL be responsive across different screen sizes
5. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL display the CV in a multi-column layout similar to the provided example
2. WHEN viewed on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to fit the screen appropriately
3. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL stack sections vertically for better readability
4. WHEN resizing the browser THEN the layout SHALL adjust smoothly without breaking
5. WHEN using touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to use Vite as the build tool and npm as the package manager, so that I have fast development builds and proper dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the project THEN the system SHALL use Vite to scaffold the React application
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use npm as the package manager
3. WHEN running the development server THEN Vite SHALL provide hot module replacement
4. WHEN building for production THEN Vite SHALL optimize the bundle size
5. WHEN installing packages THEN npm SHALL manage the node_modules and package.json correctly
